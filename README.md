# container2pc
You can use a container such as a desktop.

This project is based from this git (Apache 2.0)
https://github.com/ConSol/docker-headless-vnc-container

startup.sh sciprt is based from this git (Apache 2.0)
https://github.com/fcwu/docker-ubuntu-vnc-desktop

code-server is installed from this git (MIT)
https://github.com/cdr/code-server.git

And I add some custom feature for startup.sh script (for uid, gid and vscode run)

Just run build script.
./docker_build.sh

and do run!
./docker_run.sh
